This sample illustrates key rotation, supported as of Android Pie (9.0).

The certificate lineage file specifies our subsequent certificates.

    -certificatelineage debug.lineage

It's optional in this case, since we only have two certificates, and we're
specifying both of them. DexGuard can then create the certificate lineage
for us.

The signing keys are always required, since the certificate lineage file
contains certificates but not the corresponding private keys.

The oldest signing key is already specified in build.gradle,
- for Jar Signature Scheme v1 (old versions of Android),
- for Apk Signature Scheme v2 (Android 7.0+),
- for the certificate lineage in Apk Signature Scheme v3 (Android 9.0+),
  endorsing the newer signing key.

    -keystore         debug1.keystore
    -keystorepassword android
    -keyalias         AndroidDebugKey
    -keypassword      android

We specify the replacement signing key in dexguard-project.txt,
- for Apk Signature Scheme v3 (Android 9.0+).

    -keystore         debug2.keystore
    -keystorepassword android
    -keyalias         AndroidDebugKey
    -keypassword      android

Remember that versions of Android before P don't know of certificate lineage,
so subsequent versions of the app need to be signed with the old key in the
old signature schemes. DexGuard adds the necessary signature schemes with the
correct keys.

You can inspect the certificates in the key stores with keytool:

     keytool -list -v -keystore debug1.keystore -storepass android
     keytool -list -v -keystore debug2.keystore -storepass android

You can create the lineage file with a sufficiently recent version of apksigner:

    apksigner rotate \
      --out debug.lineage \
      --old-signer --ks debug1.keystore --ks-pass pass:android --ks-key-alias AndroidDebugKey --key-pass pass:android \
      --new-signer --ks debug2.keystore --ks-pass pass:android --ks-key-alias AndroidDebugKey --key-pass pass:android

You can verify the signatures of the apps with apksigner:

    apksigner verify --print-certs -v build/outputs/apk/debug/CertificateLineage-debug.apk
