This sample illustrates how DexGuard can harden an application that uses
in-app billing on the Google Play market.

Before building and running the sample, you should adapt it for your own Google
Play publisher account:

- src/com/example/dungeons/Security.java:
    base64EncodedPublicKey must specify the public key from your Google Play profile.

The sample configuration dexguard-project.txt then shows how to apply additional
layers of obfuscation to the combined code of the application and the library.
