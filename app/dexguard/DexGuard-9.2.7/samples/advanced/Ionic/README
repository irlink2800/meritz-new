This sample is the directory you obtain after running

    ionic cordova build android --prod --release

and navigating to the platforms/android directory. This android directory is 
here renamed to Ionic.

Important: To use asset encryption on ionic apps, you need either:
  - the cordova-plugin-ionic-webview plugin enabled 
    (standard when creating an Ionic project)
    or
  - setup your MainActivity such as in our Cordova sample 
    (see samples/advanced/Cordova/README)
