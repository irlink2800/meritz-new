This sample illustrates how DexGuard can harden an application that uses the
License Verification Library for the Google Play market.

Our copy of the library has been improved manually in a few respects:

- The string "com.android.vending.licensing.ILicensingService", originally
  encrypted with trivial Base64 encoding in LicenseChecker.java, has been
  restored, so DexGuard can encrypt it properly.
- A fundamental switch statement in LicenseValidator.java has been obfuscated.
- Some exceptions have been replaced by more generic exceptions.
- Internal exception messages have been removed.

Before building and running the sample, you should adapt it for your own Google
Play publisher account:

- src/com/example/android/market/licensing/MainActivity.java:
    BASE64_PUBLIC_KEY must specify the public key from your Google Play profile.
    SALT should define a random byte sequence.

The sample configuration dexguard-project.txt then shows how to apply additional
layers of obfuscation to the combined code of the application and the library.
