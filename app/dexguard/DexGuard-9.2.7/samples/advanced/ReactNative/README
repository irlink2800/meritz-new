This sample illustrates how you can use DexGuard to protect
a ReactNative application.

To execute it, you first have to install the node modules in the root
directory. Run the following command in the ReactNative directory:

$ npm install

When the command is executed successfully, you should see the
installed modules in node_modules.

You can now run the sample by navigating to the android/ directory and executing:

$ ./gradlew clean assembleRelease

Tap the `ReactNativeSample` icon to launch the application.


Limitations:
Asset encryption is currently not supported for ReactNative applications.
