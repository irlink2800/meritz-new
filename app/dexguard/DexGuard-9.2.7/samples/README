You can build and run the applications with Gradle, Ant, Android Studio,
Eclipse, and Maven, with their respective plugins.

1) Make sure the property sdk.dir is set in the file local.properties.
2) Type the following to build with Gradle:
       gradle installRelease
3) Try the HelloWorld application on your device or in the emulator.

You can see the differences in configuration in the dexguard-project.txt files.
